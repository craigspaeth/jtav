                p.quote As Fashion and Beauty Director of People en Espanol, people are always checking the way I look. On the red carpet, at a photo shoot or just in a normal day, I have to ALWAYS look my bests. I honestly believe real beauty starts with great skin.

My best discovery after all these years has been the JTav Clinical Skin Care &  Laser Center. JTav and her team have changed the texture of my skin. It has been smooth, radiant and glowing ever since.
