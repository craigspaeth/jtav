      p The Titan technology gives you an all-natural option to enhance skin tone. Titan uses a 
        | safe, infrared light to cause contraction of existing collagen as well as stimulation of 
        | new collagen in the deepest layer of the skin (deep dermis). The contraction of collagen 
        | along with new collagen growth results in decreased skin laxity and wrinkles. 
        | Without surgery, recovery time, or injections, Titan is an ideal solution for 
        | smoothing and tightening your face, abdomen, arms and other parts of the body.

        | treatment.  Most areas take approximately 30-60 minutes to treat, will no significant 
        | downtime afterwards. Immediately after treatment, temporary redness and mild swelling 
        | may occur, but will go away within half an hour.
