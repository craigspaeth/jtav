      p Each treatment uses a series of patented HydroPeel tipsâ€”Each one has multiple abrasive 
        | edges to exfoliate the skin several times each pass, achieving better, more even results. 
        | The unique spiral design creates a vortex effect to easily dislodge and remove impurities 
        | while simultaneously introducing hydrating skin solutions and potent antioxidants.
      h3.p-header( data-waypoint-index=3 ) The Process
      p The treatment begins with a deep cleansing and gentle exfoliation to remove dead skin cells. 
        | A gentle peel is then applied to help loosen dirt and debris from pores without irritation. 
        | Painless, automated extractions use vortex suction to clean out pores. 
        | At the end of the treatment, Antioxidants and Hyaluronic Acid are Vortex-Fused to 
        | nourish, deeply hydrate, and protect your skin.
